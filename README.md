This is a simple implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Game Rules

- Players take turns placing their tokens (X or O) in empty cells.
- The first player to get three of their tokens in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
- If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a tie.

- The game will display the winner or a tie message when the game ends.

## Files

- `index.html`: This file contains the HTML markup for the game. It sets up the basic structure of the page, including the game board and any user interface elements. It also links to the style.css and script.js files so that they can be used to style and add functionality to the game.
- `style.css`: This file contains the styles for the game. It determines the appearance of the game board and any user interface elements, such as buttons or text boxes. It is used to make the game look visually appealing and easy to use.
- `script.js`: This file contains the JavaScript code for the game. It adds interactivity to the game, allowing users to click on the board and interact with it. It also controls the game logic, determining which player goes next, when the game is over, and who the winner is. It is responsible for making the game function as a game, rather than just a static webpage.
